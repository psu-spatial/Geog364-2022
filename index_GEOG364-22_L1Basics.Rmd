# Welcome to Lab 1!

By the end of this week's lab, you will be able to:

1. Get comfortable with the lab format & how to work through them
2. Know how to get help
2. Get familiar with the RStudio interface
3. Run your first programming commands
4. Put everything together into an interactive markdown website (like this guide)
5. Understand the process for submitting assignments


## Overview 

There are 7 labs in this course. Each one will build on the last one, with support provided in a series of tutorials (see the tutorials tab).  You should NOT submit the tutorial work. We will work through the tutorials together and then your job is to submit the requirements on this page.

 **If the labs are causing major problems with your computer or your computer hardware is struggling (or you have any other software issue), Talk to Dr Greatrex**. We can  fix this and there are other options for "online R" that you can use.

## Instructions

<br>

### Download or update R/R-studio
  
 - Read [Tutorial 1.1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/GEOG364_T1_R_Basics.html#11_What_are_R_and_R-Studio).<br><br>
 - Install BOTH R and R-Studio, or create an R-Studio Cloud account. This is covered in  [Tutorial 1.2](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#12_Accessing_R__R-Studio).
 
<br>

### Getting started in R

Here you will learn about the R interface.  You do not need to save/submit this work,

 - Work through [Tutorial1.3](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#13_Getting_started) to open R-studio and change your settings.<br><br>

 - Use [Tutorial 2.1](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#2_R-Projects_and_Packages) to make your first R-project called GEOG364-Lab1-Project<br>

 - [OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED] Now work through [Tutorial 3](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#3_Basic_commands) to get used to the basics<br>
 
 - Now go back to [Tutorial 2B](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#22_R-Packages) to understand what an R-Package is and to install  the code packages/libraries we will need for this course.<br>
 
<br>  
  
### Start Markdown

 - [OPTIONAL BUT HIGHLY ENCOURAGED] Work through [Tutorial 4](https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2021/pg_Tut4_markdown.html) to make your first Markdown document.  Save and close - this was for your reference!

<br>


### Lab challenge!

Everything above was for your own learning - you do not need to submit any of it.  Now we will start the actual lab you will submit.  Consider printing this out and checking off each step one by one.

<br>

#### 1: Reopen R studio {-} 

First, see if you remember how to close and re-open R studio. <br>

Save everything then close down R studio.To re-open, do not reopen R from the programmes folder or icon!  

**INSTEAD, GO TO THE LAB 1 FOLDER ON YOUR COMPUTER AND DOUBLE CLICK THE .RPROJ FILE CALLED GEOG364-Lab1-Project!**.  

This will get you straight back into your lab folder for you to carry on.

<br>

#### 2: Make lab-Markdown {-} 

Create a new **RMarkdown document** called `GEOG364-Lab1-PSUID.Rmd`. e.g. for me *GEOG364-Lab1-hlg5155.Rmd*.  <br>

Delete all the text/code below line 11 (e.g. everything from "R Markdown onward")

<br>

#### 3: Adding paragraphs {-}

You might find it easier to use the markdown visual text editor.  <br> Click the "A" symbol at the top right to switch (instructions here:[Tutorial 4.6](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#46_Formatting_text))


- In the white text area, create a level 1 heading called *"Introduction to GEOG-364"*.  For a cheat sheet to help with this, move your mouse to the top of the page, click the help menu, then click Markdown Quick reference, or see [Tutorial 4.6](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#46_Formatting_text).  

 - Leave a blank line, then use the GEOG-364 syllabus to describe the course late policy in your own words (e.g. you're writing about this in the white space).
 
 -  Press "knit" at the top of the screen.  If you haven't made a mistake a pop up should appear with a html file and your edits.  If you have a made a mistake, stop and fix before continuing.

<br>  


#### 4: Code showcase {-}


```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/Lab1_Basics_CodeChunk.png")
```
<br<

Leave another blank line and add a new Level 1 heading called *"Code Showcase"*.  Add a blank line afterwards too.  Create a code chunk ().  Inside use R code to calculate the following  <br><br>

  - 103^3^  (e.g `103*103*103`, or `103^3`) <br>
  
  - The co-sine of your age (google is your friend, google R function for cosine) <br>
  
  - Use R code to work out how many characters are in [the longest town name in Wales](https://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/09/how-to-pronounce-the-longest-place-name-in-the-u-k) *Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch*. <br>
     + Hint 1, remember you can copy paste this into your code. <br>
     + Hint 2.. your tutorials and quote marks!<br>
     + Hint 3.. you can google any R command, try gooling R command for number of characters in a word.<br><br>
  
 
Press "knit" at the top of the screen.  If you haven't made a mistake a pop up should appear with a html file and your edits. If you have a made a mistake, stop and fix before continuing.

<br>

#### 5. Packages  {-}

If you have run through the tutorials, you should have installed all the packages you need for this course.

**IF NOT GO AND DO THE BULK INSTALL IN [Tutorial 2.2](https://psu-spatial.github.io/geog364-2022/T1_R_Basics.html#22_R-Packages)]**

You only need to _download_ the packages once, but we still need to load them every time we need a command in that package (in the same way you only download your banking app once from the app store but need to press the icon every time you want to use it).

- Always INSTALL/DOWNLOAD packages using a menu or in the console
- Always LOAD packages in a code-chunk in your script (as we need to do tihs every time)


##### DO THIS PART EVEN IF YOU DID TUTORIAL 2!  

Today we will be using commands from the skimr package, the ggplot2 package and the plotly package.

Somewhere near the topc of your script, make a new code chunk and add this code. Remember to run the code chunk! (pressing the green arrow, or go to the run button on the top right and press Run All)

```{r,warnings=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(ggpubr)
```


<br>



#### 6: Data summary  {-}

Part 6 is taken from this tutorial (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html). 

Leave a blank line, and create a new heading called *Car Analysis*.  Leave a blank line afterwards too.  

We’re going to work with another table of data that’s already pre-loaded into R, this time inside the ggplot2 package. Make sure you have run the library code chunk.  Now, type the `?mpg` command in the console. This will bring up the help file. If it can't find the dataset, you need to load the ggplot2 package using the library command or install ggplot2.

Now look at the data itself. In the **CONSOLE**, type `View(mpg)`. This will open a new tab with the spreadsheet itself.  DO NOT PUT THE VIEW COMMAND IN A CODE CHUNK (it messes up you making your final file)



Also look at the summary statistics. Leave a blank line and create a new code chunk containing the following code

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# mpg comes from the ggplot2 package
# skim comes from the skimr package
skim(mpg)
```

and finally, let's make your first plot.

Among the variables in the mpg dataset are:

 - `displ`, a car’s engine size, in litres.

 - `hwy`, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

 - `class`, the class of car e.g. mini, SUV, pick up..
 
To make a nice looking plot, let's use the ggplot package rather than the basic r commands.

```{r,  eval=FALSE}
# ggplotly comes from the plotly package
# Choose the dataset and tell R the columns to plot
p <- ggplot(data = mpg) +                  
     geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) 

ggplotly(p)  # Plot interactively
```

Now below your code, answer the following questions. Make your answers neat using things like, ysub headings, or bold/italic text or bullet points (see that R cheatsheet). 

Press knit a lot! Check you haven’t made a mistake, check it all works.

**QUESTION 6A**

Based on this dataset, design me a study of your choice - completing this template.  There are lots of possible studies, so choose your own!  You do not have to do any analysis, I'm asking you to do this so you can prove you understand the concepts.

1. The object of observation:
2. The object of analysis for your particular study:
3. The population: 
3. List the available variables:
4. Your response variable:
5. What are you hoping to find out?

**QUESTION 6B**

What is the mean/average manufacturing year of the car models in the dataset?

**QUESTION 6C**

As fully as possible, describe the relationship between car’s engine size and its fuel efficiency on the highway 



<br>

#### 7. Above & beyond  {-}

Remember that an A is 94%, so you can ignore this section and still easily get an A.

But here is your time to shine. Also, if you are struggling in another part of the lab, you can use this to gain back points.

**To get the final 4 marks in the lab, you need to show me something new, e.g. you need to go above and beyond the lab questions in some way.** 

 - You get 2/4 for doing something new in any way
 - You get 4/4 for something really impressive or multiple small things.
 
**Tell us at the end of your R script what you did or you do not get the marks!**

Here in lab 1, maybe you added in different text formats to make your lab script more clear (bold/italic etc).  Maybe you worked out how to add axis labels to ggplot (note, it's a pain), maybe you used nested headings or sub-headings, or worked out how to add a table of contents.   

Or here are some ideas...

## Submitting your Lab

Remember to save your work throughout and to spell check your writing (next to the save button). Now, press the knit button again. If you have not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a html file in your lab 1 folder which includes your answers. If you look at your lab 1 folder, you should see this there - complete with a very recent time-stamp.

In that folder, double click on the html file.  This will open it in your browser. CHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT.

If you are on R studio cloud, see Tutorial 1 for how to download your files

Now go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file in Lab 1.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/Lab_ToSubmit.png")
```

<br>

## Lab 1 submission check-list

See the table below for what this means - 100% is hard to get!

**HTML FILE SUBMISSION - 8 marks**

**RMD CODE SUBMISSION - 8 marks**

**MARKDOWN/CODE STYLE - 10 MARKS**

Your code and document is neat and easy to read. LOOK AT YOUR HTML FILE IN YOUR WEB-BROWSER BEFORE YOU SUBMIT.  There is also a spell check next to the save button.  You have written your answers below the relevant code chunk in full sentences in a way that is easy to find and grade. For example, you have written in full sentences, it is clear what your answers are referring to. 
    
**Introduction to GEOG-364: 10 MARKS** 

You have described the lab late policy clearly in a way I could share with a new student.

**Code Showcase: 20 MARKS** 

You have managed to successfully complete all the code challenges
 
**Car analysis: 30 MARKS** 

You included all the code and successfully answered the 3 questions, providing reasoning where appropriate

**Above and beyond: 4 MARKS**
 
Here you need to go above and beyond the lab questions in some way.  Here in lab 1, maybe you added in different text formats to make your lab script more clear (bold/italic etc).  Maybe you worked out how to add axis labels to ggplot (note, it's a pain), maybe you used nested headings or sub-headings, or worked out how to add a table of contents.  

You get 2/4 for doing something new in any way and 4/4 for something really impressive or multiple small things.


[100 marks total]


Overall, here is what your lab should correspond to:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rubric <- readxl::read_excel("index_GEOG364_22_LRubric.xlsx")
knitr::kable(rubric) %>%   
  kable_classic_2() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "responsive"))


```
