# OVERVIEW

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like the new format?

## Learning Objectives

The aim of this week's lab is to get comfortable reading in and managing
spatial and non-spatial datasets. In the R-community, they often use the
jargon "Data Wranging".

SEE CANVAS FOR SUBMISSION DATES.

## Get help

If a link to a tutorial is broken, you should be able to go to the
tutorial number and find it in the menu.

Teams is the fastest way to get help. [CLICK THIS LINK FOR THE TEAMS

# LAB SET-UP

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Create your Lab 3 Project

You need a separate Lab 3 Project.

-   Using R-CLOUD? : click here. This also has instructions on
    uploading/downloading code from your computers.
    -   <https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2022/index_GEOG364-22_Tutorial_R.html#2_R-Studio_CLOUD>
        <br><br>
-   Using YOUR LAPTOP? : Click here:
    -   <https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2022/index_GEOG364-22_Tutorial_R.html#3_R-Studio_Desktop>

<br>

## Use a template

You now have a few choices on making a professional lab script

#### Option 1: Use the template you made {.unnumbered}

Go back to Lab 2 or wherever you stored your template, copy the .Rmd
into your lab 3 project folder (uploading it into lab 3 project if
you're on the cloud website). Then open your Lab 3 project, open the
.Rmd file, rename & edit the YAML - and you're set!

If you want to go down this route but didn't make one, simply follow
tutorial 10
(<https://psu-spatial.github.io/Geog364-2022/index_GEOG364-22_Tutorial_R.html#10_R-Markdown_REPORT_TEMPLATE>)
<br><br>

#### Option 2: Use a professional template NEW {.unnumbered}

In your show-me-something new, several of you found cool new packages
that make very professional looking templates. This lab for example is
in Robobook by Rmdformats. If you want to try these, instructions in
installing the R packages and installing the templates on these website

-   `PACKAGE Rmdformats` To use and install, click here:
    <https://github.com/juba/rmdformats> (scroll to near the bottom for
    installation) <br><br>

-   `PACKAGE epuRate` Yo use and install go here.
    <https://github.com/holtzy/epuRate>. To see what it looks like, see
    here: <https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/> <br><br>

-   `PACKAGE epuRate` Yo use and install go here.
    <https://github.com/holtzy/epuRate>. To see what it looks like, see
    here: <https://holtzy.github.io/Pimp-my-rmd/> <br><br>

Have fun..

<br>

## Add libraries & code options

Edit the first "set-up" code chunk so it looks like this and run/knit to
load. You might need additional libraries as you work through the lab.
If so, add them here.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE)

# LIBRARIES
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggpubr)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(knitr)
library(sp)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
```

If you see a little yellow bar at the top asking you to install them,
click yes!

<br><br>

# CODE SHOWCASE

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have a code showcase section in your lab report.

## Data Wrangling

#### Learn about data wrangling {.unnumbered}

To learn about "data wrangling", Skim-read Lab 2 in this wonderful lab
book by Dr Noli Brazil: <https://crd150.github.io/lab2.html#Tibbles>
<br><br>

#### Test your knowledge {.unnumbered}

Complete CHAPTER 1 of this datacamp course on the tidyverse. (See Canvas
on how to access)
<https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse>
<br><br>

Include a screenshot in your lab report to show you did it. <br><br>

## Interesting graphics & "comments"

Several of you have already found the R graph gallery. It's a great
place to learn how to make professional graphics.

#### Choose your favorite graphic {.unnumbered}

-   Go here: <https://r-graph-gallery.com/> <br>
-   Choose any plot you like - look around there are some beautiful ones
    <br>

#### Get the example code running {.unnumbered}

-   EVERY PLOT contains "reproducible code" that you should be able to
    simply copy/paste. So make a new code chunk, copy in the code and
    run it. You might need to install some new packages (remember to
    move any `library` commands to your set-up line) <br>
-   You do not need to run this on your own data in any way.

#### Add code comments {.unnumbered}

Code comments are little snippets of text inside the code chunk itself.
**This should never be for your main text**; instead it is used to
explain the code itself to future users.

```{r}
# This is a comment, added after a #
# lalalala
x <- 1+1  # see the computer ignores after the #
```

Here is a better comment:

```{r}
#----------------------------------------------------
# Counting letters
#----------------------------------------------------

# Choose input data and set to myword
 my_word <- "Hello"
 
 # nchar() counts the number of characters/letters in myword
 wordyoutput <- nchar(my_word)
```

Use this example to add comments and tweak the formatting/indents of
your R graph gallery code to make it easy to follow . Specifically, for
each line or section, add a comment explaining what that bit of code
does <br><br>

Hint to work it out:

-   R code is normally OUTPUT \<- `command`(Input) . So you can look at
    the help file for the command, and View(), print() or click on the
    inputs and outputs to look at them.

-   For example, above<br>

     +  The input is "Hello", saved as my_word. So I could type my_word
        into the console to take a look if I wasn't sure <br>

     +  The command is nchar and I could use ?nchar to look at the
        helpfile. I can tell its a command because of the
        parentheses <br>

     +  This then makes an output, which I save as the variable
        wordyoutput. So I could type wordyoutput into the console to
        take a look if I wasn't sure what it was going on. <br>

<br>

# MAIN ANALYSIS

Next month, your boss is moving to Sindian Dist., in New Taipei City, Taiwan.  They want to buy a house and have asked you to figure out what most impacts house price.  You found a dataset that might help

Reading more about the data here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Real+estate+valuation+data+set).

<br>

## Read in the data

Download the "Lab03_house.xlsx" dataset from the Lab page on canvas and put it into your Lab 3 folder.  Use the `read_excel()` command to read it in and save it to a variable called house:

```{r}
# This only works if you are running your lab 3 project
house <- readxl::read_excel("Lab03_house.xlsx")
```

Either click on the word house in environment, or use the command `View(house)` in the console to take a look.  

<br>

## Summarise the study

Remember you are writing this report for your boss and 10/100 is on how professional your report looks.  Using a similar structure to last week to include this information (edit as you wish).  

1. A [very] short background, just a few sentences summarizing the study/user <br><br>
 
2. Data description, including: <br>
     - The object of analysis <br>
     - The population: 
        + e.g. what population is your boss is interested in? Is this dataset a representative sample? <br>
     - The variables INCLUDING UNITS.  Remember I included a link to the website above...
     - The response variable you are interested in <br>

```{r, include=FALSE}
summary(house)
hist(house$Distance.Station)
```

## Filter out some data 

### Explore station distances: {-}

Your boss does not want to live more than 3km from a station.  Create a professional looking histogram of the Distance.Station  column (e.g.`house$Distance.Station` ).  Remember R Graph gallery.  Describe the data in the text (e.g mean distance, range of distances, is the distribution skewed?)

### Filter out stations {-}

Use what you learned in code showcase to filter the dataset so that it only contains rows that are LESS than 3 km (3000 m) from a station.  Save it as a new variable called house_subset. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
house_subset <- house[house$Distance.Station < 3000,]
```


Write how many rows you removed.   
 - *Hint, look at the environment tab, or use the `dim` command to get the number of rows and columns*

## Exploratory analysis of the response 

Your boss has a series of questions.  Analyse the data and include your code and answer in your report.

 - On average, how much are house prices in this area?
 - What's the range/distribution of prices?
 
 - Does the price depend on the house age? (hint, make a scatterplot and then describe the result in words, no formal stats tests needed)
      + *Hint Making scatterplots: https://r-graph-gallery.com/scatterplot.html* <br>
      + *Hint: Describing scatterplots: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/bivariate-data-ap/scatterplots-correlation/a/describing-scatterplots-form-direction-strength-outliers?modal=1* <br>
      
 - Similarly, (remember your Latitude column), are house prices cheaper, or more expensive in the South?

## Spatial

Finally, we wish to understand the spatial structure of the data

 - Explain whether this dataset is vector or raster. If vector, what type of data is it?. <br>
 
### Making maps {-}

At the moment, R does not understand our data is "spatial" e.g that the longitude and latitude columns have some special meaning.  This is not a good map..

```{r}
plot(house$Longitude,house$Latitude)
```

The `st_as_sf` command explains to the computer that the data is "special" and tells it where the x-coordinates (Longitude) and the y-coordinates (Latitude) are.

Add this code to your lab reports. 

```{r}
house.spatial <- st_as_sf(house,coords=c("Longitude","Latitude"),crs = 4326)
# instant plot
plot(house.spatial)
```

Let's make a better plot. Add this code to make a good looking plot of the house prices.


```{r}
# make interactive, for static set as "plot"
tmap_mode("view")

# Command from the tmap library
# and plot
tm_basemap("Esri.WorldTopoMap") + 
     qtm(house.spatial, # data
         symbols.col="House.Price", # which column for the symbols
         symbols.alpha=0.9, # transparency
         symbols.size=.2, # how big
         symbols.palette="Spectral", #colors from https://colorbrewer2.org
         symbols.style="fisher") # color breaks
```


Above, I asked you to analyse if houses were more expensive in the South. 

 - Use this map to explain what is actually going on in terms of spatial distributions of price.  E,g, Is there some spatial characteristic that is more important than latitude in predicting house prices in your dataset?  <br>
- How does this link to the "Non Uniformity of Space?"
  + we will discuss this next week, but its in the textbook/google.


# ABOVE & BEYOND

Remember that an A is 94%, so you can ignore this section and still easily get an A. But here is your time to shine. Also, if you are struggling in another part of the lab, you can use this to gain back points.


In the `st_as_sf` command, the final bit is crs = 4326. 

Use google/ the help files to xplain what is going on.. What is this "4326"? Are there other numbers?  Two for a brief comment, four for something more detailed. 


<br>

# SUBMITTING YOUR LAB

Remember to save your work throughout and to spell check your writing
(next to the save button). Now, press the knit button again. If you have
not made any mistakes in the code then R should create a html file in
your Lab folder which includes your answers.

## On laptops

-   Go to your 364 folder and look for your lab folder. <br>

-   You should see a .html file (edge/chrome) complete with a very
    recent time-stamp.html file along with a .rmd file with a recent
    time-stamp <br>

-   In that folder, double click on the html file. This will open it in
    your browser. CHECK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO SUBMIT. <br>

-   Now go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/Lab_ToSubmit.png")
```

<br> <br> <br>

## On R studio cloud

-   If you are on R studio cloud, see XXXXX for how to download your
    files

<br>

-   Now go to Canvas and submit BOTH your html and your .Rmd file.

<br> <br> <br>
